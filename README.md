# Weather-App
Project Description - A simple weather app that retrieves and displays the current weather data for a given location using the OpenWeatherMap API.
This is a basic example of how to build a simple weather app using a REST API with Python and Flask. You could expand on this example by adding more data and functionality to the app.
